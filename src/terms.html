                    Welcome to Kayakfirst. We are passionate about creating innovative products and services to empower athletes everywhere, and we are thrilled to have you on our team. These Terms and Conditions of Use are the rules of the game – designed to create a positive, law-abiding community of our athletes. By using Kayakfirst’s products and services, you are agreeing to all the terms below.
<br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst Kft. and its affiliates and subsidiaries, including Best Paddle Kft. (collectively referred to throughout as “Kayakfirst,” “we” or “us”), offer a variety of products and services, including the Kayakfirst-branded fitness and paddle sports related websites, applications, devices, hardware, content and other technology products and services; our e-commerce websites and applications (“Kayakfirst Ergometer App”); and all other current and future digital products and service offerings we make available, including any products and services provided in collaboration with our partners (collectively, the “Services”). We are driven to create Services that enhance the lives and performance of all athletes everywhere, and that’s why we refer to online and offline community members as “athletes.”
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    These Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our Services. Please read the Terms carefully before using our Services, as they are a legally binding contract between you and Kayakfirst. Note that we have included several summaries at the top of each section – these summaries are not a part of the contract itself, but are intended to emphasize key sections and help you follow the text.
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Your access and use of the Services (regardless of whether you create an account with us), constitutes your agreement to these Terms and our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into the Terms. Stated alternatively, if you disagree with any part of the Terms, then you are not permitted to use our Services. Further, by accessing and using our Services, you understand and agree that your Personal Data (as that term is defined in our Privacy Policy) and User-Generated Content (defined below) that is shared with a Service may also be shared among the entirety of Kayakfirst and its other Services.
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Please feel free to contact us through our Support Team if you have any questions or suggestions.
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    1. Use of the Services and Your Account
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (a) Who can use the Kayakfirst Services
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst supports and encourages athletes of all ages, but you must be at least 13 to use most of the Services.
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Your Account
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You may need to create an Kayakfirst account to access the Services, and it's important that the information associated with your account is accurate and up-to-date (particularly your email address – if you ever forget your password, a working email address is often the only way for us to verify your identity and help you log back in).
                    <br /><br />
                    You may need to register for an Kayakfirst account in order to access or use certain Services. Your account may automatically provide you access and means to use new Services that we create.
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    When you create an account for any of our Services, you must provide us with accurate and complete information as prompted by the account creation and registration process, and keep that information up to date. Otherwise, some of our Services may not operate correctly, and we may not be able to contact you with important notices.
                    <br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you create an account, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any and all actions that take place while using your account, and you must notify our Support Team right away of any actual or suspected loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your account or account password. We are not responsible for any loss that results from unauthorized use of your username and password, with or without your knowledge.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you forget your password and have an existing Kayakfirst account, click on the “Sign In” or “Log In” link at the top of the page. You will be taken to the Sign In page, where you can select “Forgot Password” to create a new password.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (c) Service Updates, Changes and Limitations
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Our Services are constantly evolving to be more useful for our athletes and community. With new products, services, and features launching all the time, we need the flexibility to make changes, impose limits, and occasionally suspend or terminate certain offerings. We may also update our Services, which might not work properly if you don’t install the updates.
                    <br /><br />
                    The Services change frequently, and their form and functionality may change without prior notice to you. We may also impose limits on certain Services or restrict your access to part or all of the Services without notice or liability.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We may also from time to time, as we see fit, develop and provide updates for certain Services. This may include upgrades, modifications, bug fixes, patches and other error corrections and/or new features (collectively, “Updates”). Certain portions of our Services may not properly operate if you do not install all Updates. These Updates may include updated versions of our applications, which may automatically electronically upgrade the versions used on your device, as well as updates to wearables and other connected products. You expressly consent to such automatic Updates. Further, you agree that the Terms (and any additional modifications of the same) will apply to any and all Updates to the Services. We have no obligation to provide any Updates or to continue to provide or enable any particular features or functionality of any Service.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (d) Service Monitoring and Suspension
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone, and can monitor, terminate or suspend our Services or your account at any time.
                    <br /><br />
                    We may change, suspend, or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time, including the availability of any product, feature, database, or Content. We may also deactivate, terminate or suspend your account at any time.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor any accounts and/or activities conducted through or in any way related to the Services (including inviting a fellow athlete into a network of friends), as well as any athlete’s use of or access to Location Data (as that term is defined in our Privacy Policy), Personal Data, and profiles of other athletes.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (e) Security
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Please let us know right away if you believe your account has been hacked or compromised.
                    <br /><br />
                    We care about the security of our athletes. While we work hard to protect the security of your Personal Data, User-Generated Content, and account, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security measures. Please notify our Support Team immediately of any actual or suspected breach or unauthorized access or use of your account.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (f) Consent to Receive Communications
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We or other athletes in the community may contact you in connection with your use of the Services. We have outlined how you can manage some of these settings here.
                    <br /><br />
                    After signing up for an account, you may receive periodic email communications regarding the operations of our Services. You cannot opt out of receiving these communications while you continue to use our Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You may also receive periodic promotions and other offers or materials that we believe might be of interest to you. You can opt out of receiving these promotional messages at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the message footer, or changing the email preferences in your account.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    By finding and connecting with your friends and other athletes in our community, you may receive electronic communications, including messages from them (depending on your preferences, you may receive notification of these messages via email, in the website/application, and/or as a push notification). You can manage the messages you receive from other athletes in our Services by changing the preferences in your account.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (a) Definitions
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Content is the stuff that shows up on your display when you use our Services. User-Generated Content is any Content that is created by you or other athletes, and Kayakfirst Content is all other Content.
                    <br /><br />

Content includes, without limitation, all User-Generated Content; and (iii) the term “Kayakfirst Content” means all Content that is not User-Generated Content.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Ownership
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You own the Content that you create, and we own the Content that we create. Please don’t post other people’s work without permission.
                    <br /><br />
                    All copyright, trademarks, design rights, patents and other intellectual property rights (registered and unregistered) in and on the Services and Kayakfirst Content belong to Kayakfirst and/or its partners or applicable third parties.

Except as expressly provided in the Terms, nothing in the Terms grants you a right or license to use any Kayakfirst Content, including any content owned or controlled by any of our partners or other third parties. You agree that you will respect the intellectual property rights of others, and represent and warrant that you have all of the necessary rights to grant Kayakfirst a license (described further in part (d) below) for all User-Generated Content you submit in connection with the Services.

                    <br /><br />
                    Automated Querying. Do not send automated queries of any sort to the systems and networks we use to provide the Services without our express written permission. “Sending automated queries” includes but is not limited to:
                    <br /><br />
                    using any software that sends automated queries to the systems and networks we use to provide the Services that seek bulk data, or determine how many saved routes or athletes we have for various queries;
                    <br /><br />
                    “meta-searching” the Services and the systems and networks we use to provide the Services; and
                    <br /><br />
                    performing “offline” searches relative to the Services.
                    <br /><br />
                    Unlawful Uses. You may only use the Kayakfirst Content and Services for legally permitted purposes. You may not use the Services or any Kayakfirst Content or other information displayed on or made available by the Services to stalk, harass, abuse, defame, threaten, or defraud others.
                    <br /><br />
                    (d) Your License to Us
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    When you post content in connection with the Services, it still belongs to you – however, you’re giving us permission to use that content in certain ways in connection with our Services and make the content available to others. We can edit or remove your content from our products and services at any time for any reason.
                    <br /><br />
                    When you provide User-Generated Content to Kayakfirst through the Services, you grant Kayakfirst and our athletes a non-exclusive, irrevocable, royalty-free, freely transferable, sublicensable, worldwide right and license to use, host, store, cache, reproduce, publish, display (publicly or otherwise), perform (publicly or otherwise), distribute, transmit, modify, adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Services are available), commercialize, create derivative works of, and otherwise exploit such User-Generated Content in connection with any and all Services. You acknowledge and agree that: (a) we have the right to arrange the posting of User-Generated Content in any way we desire; (b) Kayakfirst has no obligation to provide you with any credit when using your User-Generated Content, but if Kayakfirst chooses to provide you with credit, the size and placement of the credit is at our sole discretion; (c) you waive any “moral rights” in your User-Generated Content; and (d) you are not entitled to any compensation or other payment from us in connection with the use of your User-Generated Content.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The rights you grant in this license are for the limited purposes of allowing Kayakfirst to operate the Services in accordance with their functionality, improve the Services, develop new Services, and to allow other community members to use the Services in accordance with their intended function. Notwithstanding the above, we will not make use of any of your User-Generated Content in a manner that is inconsistent with the privacy settings you establish within our Services. For information on managing your privacy settings for the Services, see the Kayakfirst Privacy Policy.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We reserve the right to monitor, remove or modify User-Generated Content for any reason and at any time, including User-Generated Content that we believe violates these Terms, the Community Guidelines, and/or our policies.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (e) Content Retention
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Please keep in mind that when you make something publicly available on the Internet, it becomes practically impossible to take down all copies of it in the future.
                    <br /><br />
                    Following termination of your account, or if you remove any User-Generated Content from the Services, we may retain your User-Generated Content for a commercially reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes, or as otherwise required or permitted by law. Furthermore, Kayakfirst and its athletes may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, share, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User-Generated Content that otherwise has been stored or shared through Kayakfirst. Accordingly, note that the above license to your User-Generated Content continues even if you stop using the Services. When you post something publicly, others may choose to comment on it, making your Content part of a social conversation. For more information, please review our Privacy Policy.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (f) User-Generated Content and Eligibility to Participate in Certain Sports Organizations.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Things that happen online may have consequences in the real world.
                    <br /><br />
                    Certain sports organizations have rules on amateurism and eligibility that could potentially be implicated if you post User-Generated Content within the Services, even User-Generated Content that you believe is noncommercial in nature. It is your responsibility to determine whether posting User-Generated Content within the Services will affect your eligibility to participate in any sport under any applicable rules of any sports organization.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (g) Your Feedback
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We appreciate your feedback and can freely use your suggestions to make Kayakfirst and athletes around the world better. Thank you and keep the ideas coming!
                    <br /><br />
                    We value hearing from our athletes, and are always interested in learning about ways we can make Kayakfirst awesome. If you choose to submit comments, ideas or feedback, you should submit the idea through our Idea Submission website at https://uaideas.force.com/, and you agree that we are free to use the ideas you submit without any restriction or compensation to you. By accepting your submission, Kayakfirst does not waive any rights to use similar or related feedback previously known to Kayakfirst, developed by our employees, or obtained from sources other than you. You certify and represent that the information or feedback you submit to us through the Services is not confidential or proprietary information.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (h) Trademarks
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We love your support and imitation is flattering, but please respect our trademarks and brands.
                    <br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst owns or licenses all Kayakfirst trademarks, service marks, branding, logos, and other similar assets (the “Kayakfirst Trademarks”).

                    (i) Accuracy and Reliance on Content
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Don’t believe everything you read on the Internet. If you are concerned about the accuracy of information available through the Services, undertake your own research and investigation.
                    <br /><br />
                    We make no representations or warranties as to the accuracy, reliability, completeness or timeliness of any Content available through the Services, and we make no commitment to update such Content.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    In addition, User-Generated Content, including advice, statements, or other information, including, without limitation, food, nutrition and exercise database entries, are not produced by Kayakfirst, and should not necessarily be relied on. User-Generated Content available in connection with the Services, whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the athlete from whom such User-Generated Content originated. We do not endorse any opinions or recommendations contained in User-Generated Content. All information is provided “as is” without any representation, warranty or condition as to its accuracy or reliability.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    In particular, MyFitnessPal’s food database (“Food Database”) contains a combination of nutritional information entered directly by MyFitnessPal and nutritional information entered by MyFitnessPal members. Any MyFitnessPal member can contribute nutritional information to the Food Database, as well as edit existing nutritional information. Please be advised that nutritional information found in the Food Database has not been reviewed by persons with the expertise required to provide you with complete, accurate, or reliable information. MyFitnessPal does not (i) guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any nutritional information in the Food Database; or (ii) adopt, endorse or accept responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any such nutritional information. Under no circumstances will MyFitnessPal be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on nutritional information. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any nutritional information in the Food Database is accurate, complete and useful.

                    4.Community Guidelines
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (a) Interactive Areas
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Our Services often contain community features. When you post content through these features that content may become public.
                    <br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst is a community dedicated to helping all athletes reach their fitness and wellness goals. Some of our Services may include reviews, discussion forums, conversation pages, blogs or other interactive areas or social features that allow you and other athletes to post User-Generated Content and interact with one another (“Interactive Areas”). You are solely responsible for your use of the Interactive Areas and for any User-Generated Content that you post, including the transmission, accuracy and completeness of the User-Generated Content. As the Interactive Areas are often public, you understand that your User-Generated Content may be made and remain public.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We may, but do not always, monitor our community features, and ultimately you are responsible for your interactions with other athletes. So please use good judgment and play fair.
                    <br /><br />
                    You are solely responsible for your interactions with other athletes, whether online or in person, including but not limited to comments, challenges, and friendly competition. We assume no responsibility or liability for any loss or damage resulting from any interaction with other athletes who employ the Services, individuals you meet through the Services, or individuals who find you because of Content posted on, by or through the Services. You agree to take reasonable precautions in all interactions with any athletes or individuals you interact with in connection with the Services. You are solely responsible for your involvement with any athletes or individuals you interact with in connection with the Services. Kayakfirst is under no obligation to become involved in any disputes between its athletes, but may do so at its own discretion.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Community Guidelines
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Our Services are designed as a safe and supportive environment to help you reach your fitness and wellness goals. Athletes cannot use our services to post pornographic material, harass people, send spam, violate intellectual property rights, or do other inappropriate stuff. Be reasonable and act responsibly.
                    <br /><br />
                    Our Services are intended to be a safe and supportive community for all athletes. To help everyone feel safe and to maintain that positive environment, we require everyone to agree to, and follow, these rules (the “Community Guidelines”) when posting User-Generated Content and using the Services. By using the Services you agree that your User-Generated Content and use of the Interactive Areas will not violate the Community Guidelines. If you violate the Community Guidelines, we reserve the right to terminate your access to the Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    No Discriminatory or Abusive Content, or Personal Attacks or Insults.
                    <br /><br />
                    Stay positive – don’t spread hate messages, and don’t post Content that is threatening, hurtful, harassing, embarrassing, or annoying to other members of the community.
                    <br /><br />
                    No derogatory references to sex, gender, age, weight, body type, disability, ethnicity, religion, or sexual orientation, or endorsement of violence against any person or group, even if couched in humor, will be permitted. This includes expressing stereotypes about any group or community.
                    <br /><br />
                    You can respectfully disagree with a message, post or topic, but please do not attack other athletes by mocking or insulting them. If you are attacked by another athlete, and you reciprocate, you may also be subject to the same consequences.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Hijacking, Trolling, or Flame-baiting. If you are participating in our forums, please stay on-topic in an existing thread, and post new threads in the appropriate forum. Taking a thread off-topic is considered hijacking. Please either contribute politely and constructively to a topic, or move on without posting. This includes posts that encourage the drama in a topic to escalate, or posts intended to incite an uproar from the community.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Promotion of Unsafe Weight-Loss Techniques or Eating Disorders. One of our goals is to provide athletes with the tools to achieve their weight management goals at a steady, sustainable rate. Use of the Services to promote, glamorize, or achieve dangerously low levels of eating is not permitted. Accordingly, please do not contribute the following types of Content, which may be removed without warning:
                    <br /><br />
                    Content intended to promote potentially unsafe or controversial weight loss products or procedures, including non-medically prescribed supplements or MLM.
                    <br /><br />
                    Profiles, groups, messages, posts, or wall comments that encourage anorexia, bulimia, or very low calorie diets. This includes positive references to ana/mia, purging, or self-starving.
                    <br /><br />
                    Photos intended to glamorize extreme thinness.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Explicit Content. Don’t post Content that is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, offensive, hateful, inflammatory, or promoting sexually explicit material.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Harm to Minors. Don’t use the Services in a way that harms minors (or anyone, really).
                    <br /><br />
                    No Sending Spam and Junk Mail. Don’t spam people via posts, replies, or messages.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Illegal Content. Don’t advocate, promote, or assist any fraudulent or illegal act (e.g., violence, impersonation and computer misuse).
                    <br /><br />
                    No Soliciting Personal Data. Please don’t post or solicit Personal Data regarding or from any third party, including photographs, telephone numbers, street addresses, last names, email addresses and passwords in the Interactive Areas.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Public Posting of Private Conversations. Don’t publicly post an email or private message from any other athlete, moderator or administrator.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Breach of Legal Duty. Don’t post Content that is in breach of any contractual or other legal duty owed to a third party.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Deceptive or Fraudulent Links. Don't post deceptive or fraudulent links. This includes giving links misleading descriptions, putting the wrong “source” field in a post, setting misleading click-through links on images, or embedding links to interstitial or pop-up ads.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Intellectual Property Infringement. Respect the intellectual property of others. If you aren’t allowed to use someone else's proprietary work or likeness (either by license or by legal exceptions and limitations such as fair use), please don’t post it. In particular, if you have any reason to believe that User-Generated Content you see on our Services is infringing your copyrights or the copyrights of others, please see the Copyright/DMCA section of our Terms.
                    <br /><br />
                    No Impersonating Kayakfirst or Others. Don’t post Content that is likely to deceive any person or be used to impersonate any person, or to misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person, including with Kayakfirst. Creating an account for the purposes of deceiving other athletes or to work around a Services suspension is not permitted and will be grounds for a permanent ban from the Services.
                    <br /><br />
                    Other. Don’t post Content that contains anything that, in Kayakfirst’s sole determination, is objectionable or inhibits any other person from using or enjoying the Services, or that may expose Kayakfirst or our athletes to any harm or liability of any kind.
                    <br /><br />
                    If we determine that you are violating the Community Guidelines or otherwise have breached the Terms, we may take actions to address the issue, including, but not limited to, terminating your right to use the Services, removing your User-Generated Content, taking legal action against you (in which case you agree that we may recover reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees) or disclosing information to law enforcement authorities. We reserve the right to enforce, or not enforce, these Community Guidelines in our sole discretion, and they don’t create a duty or contractual obligation for us to act in any particular manner.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (c) Objectionable User-Generated Content
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    It’s a big bad Internet out there, and people post inappropriate stuff on user-generated content sites all the time. We do our best to keep the community safe and secure (athletes respecting the Community Guidelines helps), but you still might run into bad stuff before we have a chance to take it down. If you spot any objectionable Content, please let us know.
                    <br /><br />
                    While we require all of our athletes to comply with the Community Guidelines and reserve the right to monitor for violations, we ultimately cannot guarantee they will comply with the Community Guidelines or these Terms. If you believe any Content submitted to our Services violates the Community Guidelines, or if you know or suspect that someone is misusing your User-Generated Content, please report it to the Customer Support Team. By consenting to the Terms, you understand and acknowledge that when you access or otherwise use the Services:
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You may be exposed to User-Generated Content from a variety of sources, and that we are not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User-Generated Content.
                    <br /><br />
                    You may be exposed to User-Generated Content shared by other athletes that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable.
                    <br /><br />
                    We cannot be held responsible for any injury or harm to you resulting from objectionable User-Generated Content or another athlete’s failure to comply with our Community Guidelines.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    7. Mobile Services
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    While we strive to make our applications available on many platforms, we can’t guarantee that our applications are compatible with your device (though please let Customer Supportknow if you have a question or problem; we want to help). If you use our applications, your standard data and messaging rates will apply, and the rules of the app store from which you are downloading will also apply.
                    <br /><br />
                    (a) Wireless Carrier and Device Considerations
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    To use or access our applications, you will need a compatible device. We also cannot guarantee that the applications will be compatible with, or available on, your device. We do not charge for use of some basic applications; however, you may need to pay some fees to use certain premium applications or features. Further, your phone company’s normal messaging, data, and other rates and fees will still apply.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Text and Mobile Messaging Express Consents

<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (d) App Stores
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you download our applications from a third-party app store (the “App Provider”), you acknowledge and agree that:
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The Terms are an agreement between us, and not with the App Provider. As between Kayakfirst and the App Provider, Kayakfirst is solely responsible for the applications;
                    <br /><br />
                    The App Provider has no obligation to provide any maintenance and support services with respect to the applications;
                    <br /><br />
                    In the event of any failure of the applications to conform to any applicable warranty, (i) you may notify the App Provider and the App Provider may refund the purchase price for the applications to you (if applicable), (ii) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the applications, and (iii) any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be, as between Kayakfirst and the App Provider, Kayakfirst’s responsibility;
                    <br /><br />
                    The App Provider is not responsible for addressing any claims you have relating to the applications or your possession and use of the applications;
                    <br /><br />
                    If a third party claims that an application infringes another party’s intellectual property rights, as between the App Provider and Kayakfirst, Kayakfirst will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by these Terms;
                    <br /><br />
                    The App Provider and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms as it relates to your license to the applications. Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of these Terms, the App Provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms as related to your license of the applications against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof; and
                    <br /><br />
                    You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the applications.


<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    8. Shopping and E-Commerce

                    It’s important to us that athletes stay healthy while training. Please be responsible and use your best judgment and common sense. We provide our Services for information purposes only, and can’t be held liable if you get injured or something goes wrong. In particular, while most of the content posted by the other athletes in our community is helpful, it is coming from strangers on the Internet and should never trump good judgment or actual medical advice.
                    <br /><br />
                    (a) Safety First
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst cares about your safety. You should consult with your healthcare provider(s) and consider the associated risks before using our Services in connection with any physical activity, wellness or fitness program. By using our Services, you agree, represent and warrant that you have received consent from your physician to participate in wellness and fitness programs, workouts, exercises or any of the related activities made available to you in connection with the Services. Everyone’s condition and abilities are different, and participating in the activities promoted by our Services is at your own risk. If you choose to participate in these activities, you do so of your own free will and accord, knowingly and voluntarily assuming all risks associated with such activities. Activities promoted by the Services may pose risks even to those who are currently in good health.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You understand and agree that we will not carry out and are not responsible for any physical inspection, supervision, preparation, execution or conduct of any activities related to or accessed or discovered via the Services (e.g., featured, official or community created challenges; routes; friendly competitions or similar activities; any single or group training activities; any Third-Party Activities or other events or activities that utilize our Services). Maps, directions and other GPS or navigation data, including data relating to your current location, may be unavailable, inaccurate or incomplete. We encourage you to always put safety first, follow applicable traffic regulations, do not change settings on your device while in motion or in unsafe areas and always be vigilant and take stock of your surroundings when exercising.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You expressly agree that your athletic activities, which may generate the User-Generated Content you post or seek to post on or via the Services (e.g., running, walking, cycling, hiking) and certain Third-Party Activities carry certain inherent and significant risks of property damage, bodily injury, or death and that you voluntarily assume all known and unknown risks associated with these activities, even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction, or negligence of Kayakfirst or by the action, inaction, or negligence of others.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Except as otherwise set out in these Terms, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we are not responsible or liable, either directly or indirectly, for any injuries or damages that are sustained from your physical activities or your use of, or inability to use, any Services or features of the Services, including any Content or activities that you access or learn about through our Services (e.g., a Third-Party Activity such as a yoga class), even if caused in whole or part by the action, inaction or negligence of Kayakfirst or by the action, inaction or negligence of others. You also expressly agree that we do not assume responsibility for any Third-Party Activity or any other race, contest, class, athletic activity or event that utilizes or is promoted by or accessed via the Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Not Medical Advice We aim to provide useful general information for our community, not professional medical advice. The Services are not medical devices, and the data provided by them is not intended to be utilized for medical purposes and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease, ailment or injury. You expressly agree that we are not providing medical advice via the Services. All Content provided through the Services, whether provided by us or by other athletes or third parties (even if they are claiming to be a doctor!) is not intended to be and should not be used in place of (a) the advice of your physician or other professionals, (b) a visit, call or consultation with your physician or other medical professionals, or (c) information contained on or in any product packaging or label. We are not responsible for any health problems that may result from training programs, consultations, products, or events you learn about through the Services. Should you have any health related questions, please call or see your physician or other healthcare provider promptly. If you have an emergency, call your physician or your local emergency services immediately.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Your use of the Services does not constitute or create a doctor-patient, therapist-patient or other healthcare professional relationship between Kayakfirst and you.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (c) Accuracy
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The Services are intended to provide you with information to encourage you to support your wellness and fitness activities. Some of the Services are aimed at tracking your physical movements and sleep activity (“Activity Tracking Services”). These Activity Tracking Services rely on sensors and/or GPS functionality that track your movement or body at rest. The data and information provided by the Activity Tracking Services are intended to be a representation of your activity, but may not be completely accurate, including with respect to step, sleep, speed, distance, or calorie data.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    11. Modifications to the Terms and Product-Specific Terms
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    As Kayakfirst grows and improves, we might have to make changes to these Terms or include additional terms that are specific to certain products.
                    <br /><br />
                    (a) Updates to these Terms
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst reserves the right to modify these Terms by (i) posting revised Terms on and/or through the Services, and/or (ii) providing notice to you of material changes to the Terms, generally via email where practicable, and otherwise through the Services (such as through a notification on the home page of the Kayakfirst websites or in our applications). Modifications will not apply retroactively unless required by law.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to or reject a revised version of the Terms. In such cases, modifications will be effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of the Terms. If you do not agree at that time, you are not permitted to use the Services. In cases where we do not ask for your explicit agreement to a modified version of the Terms, the modified version of the Terms will become effective as of the date specified in the Terms. Your use of the Services following that date constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms as modified. If you do not agree to the modifications, you are not permitted to use, and should discontinue your use of, the Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Product-Specific Terms
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We may also require you to agree to additional terms, rules, policies, guidelines, or other conditions (collectively, “Product-Specific Terms”) that are specific to certain Services (for example, the Commercial Tools). In such cases, you may be required to expressly consent to Product-Specific Terms. For instance, you might need to check a box or click on a button marked “I agree.” If any of the Product-Specific Terms are different than the Terms, the Product-Specific Terms will supplement, amend, or supersede the Terms, but only with respect to the subject matter of the Product-Specific Terms.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    11. No Warranties
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTEES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER THE LAW. THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITH ALL FAULTS BASIS. Without limiting the foregoing, you understand that we make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of any of the Services or any Content. We do not warrant that (i) the Services will meet your requirements, (ii) the operation of the Services will be uninterrupted, virus- or error-free or free from other harmful elements or (iii) errors will be corrected. Any oral or written advice provided by our agents or us does not and will not create any warranty. We also make no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to Content; User-Generated Content, in particular, is provided by and is solely the responsibility of the athletes providing that Content. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained from other athletes or through the Services, will create any warranty not expressly made herein. You therefore expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Services is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    12. Limitation of Liability
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We are building the best Services we can for you but we can't promise they will be perfect. We're not liable for various things that could go wrong as a result of your use of the Services.
                    <br /><br />
                    To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, under no circumstances (including, without limitation, negligence) shall Kayakfirst, its subsidiaries, partners or any wireless carriers be liable to you or any third party for (a) any indirect, incidental, special, reliance, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages of any kind whatsoever; (b) loss of profits, revenue, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses; (c) damages relating to your access to, use of, or inability to access or use the Services; (d) damages relating to any conduct or content of any third party or athlete using the Services, including without limitation, defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct or content; and/or (e) damages in any manner relating to any Third-Party Content, Third-party Products or Third-Party Activities accessed via the Services. This limitation applies to all claims, whether based on warranty, contract, tort, or any other legal theory, whether or not Kayakfirst has been informed of the possibility of such damage, and further where a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed its essential purpose. The total liability of Kayakfirst, for any claim under these Terms, including for any implied warranties, is limited to the greater of one thousand dollars (us $1,000.00) or the amount you paid us to use the applicable Service(s) in the past twelve months.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    In particular, we are not liable for any claims arising out of (a) your use of the Services (including but not limited to your participation in any activities promoted by or accessed via the Services), (b) the use, disclosure, display, or maintenance of an athlete’s Personal Data and/or Location Data, (c) any other interactions with us or any other athletes using the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages, or (d) other Content, information, services or goods received through or advertised on the Services or received through any links provided with the Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You acknowledge and agree that we offer the Services and set the Services’ prices in reliance upon the warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability set forth in the Terms. You also acknowledge and agree that these warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability reflect a reasonable and fair allocation of risk between you and us and that these warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between you and us. We would not be able to provide the Services to you on an economically reasonable basis without these warranty disclaimers, releases, and limitations of liability.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you are a resident of California: You waive your rights with respect to California Civil Code Section 1542, which says “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you are a resident of the UK: For the purposes of English law, nothing in these Terms limits or excludes our responsibility for fraudulent representations made by us or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    13. Indemnification
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If we are sued because of your access or use of the Services, you have to pay our costs.
                    <br /><br />
                    You agree to indemnify and hold Kayakfirst, its subsidiaries, suppliers and other partners harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable accounting and attorneys’ fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) the User-Generated Content you access or share through the Services; (b) your use of the Services, (c) your athletic activities in connection with the Services (including, but not limited to, athletic activities in connection with any contests, races, group activities, Third-Party Activities or other events that we may sponsor, organize, participate in, or where the Services are employed), (d) your connection to the Services, (e) your violation of these Terms, (f) your use or misuse of any athlete’s Personal Data and Location Data, (g) any violation of the rights of any other person or entity by you, or (h) your employment of the Services to meet another athlete in person or to locate and attend any offline place or event. We reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us under the Terms, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    14. Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Maryland and controlling U.S. federal law as applicable, without regard to its conflict of law principles.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    15. Disputes and Arbitration
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If we have a problem, let’s practice good sportsmanship.
                    <br /><br />
                    You and we agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes relating to your use of the services under the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Please visit www.adr.org for more information about arbitration.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Any arbitration between you and us, to the extent necessary, will be conducted in Baltimore, Maryland, and you waive any right to claim that such location is an inconvenient forum. You agree not to sue us or bring arbitration in any other forum.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The arbitration will be conducted in English. A single independent and impartial arbitrator will be appointed pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Both you and we agree to comply with the following rules, which are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the costs and burdens for everyone involved:
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration;
                    <br /><br />
                    the arbitration will not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by the parties; and
                    <br /><br />
                    any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
                    <br /><br />
                    Barring extraordinary circumstances, the arbitrator will issue his or her decision within 120 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit for an additional 30 days in the interests of justice. All arbitration proceedings will be closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will include a statement describing the reasons for the disposition of any claim.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You also acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with us arising out of or relating to your use of the Services:
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You are giving up your right to have a trial by jury;
                    <br /><br />
                    You are giving up your right to serve as a representative, as a private attorney general, or in any other representative capacity, or to participate as a member of a class of claimants, in any lawsuit involving any such dispute; and
                    <br /><br />
                    You must file any claim within one (1) year after such claim arose or it is forever barred.
                    <br /><br />
                    If this arbitration provision is found to be null and void, then all disputes arising under the Terms between us will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Baltimore, Maryland, and you and we hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of these courts.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    This agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Kayakfirst from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration, including without limitation orders to stay a court action, compel arbitration or confirm an arbitral award, from a court of competent jurisdiction. Furthermore, this agreement to arbitrate will not preclude you or Kayakfirst from applying to the appropriate court of competent jurisdiction for a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or other interim or conservatory relief, as necessary.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    In the event of any litigation or arbitration arising from or related to these Terms, or the Services provided, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs incurred including staff time, court costs, attorneys’ fees, and all other related expenses incurred in such litigation or arbitration.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    16. International Terms
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you are not a United States resident and you are accessing our Services from outside the United States, you agree to transfer certain information outside your home country to us, and that you will follow all the laws that apply to you.
                    <br /><br />
                    We provide our Services for a global community of athletes. Our servers and operations are, however, located primarily in the United States, and our policies and procedures are based primarily on United States law. Because of this, the following provisions apply specifically to athletes located outside of the United States: (i) you consent to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information, including but not limited to User-Generated Content and any Personal Data, to and in the United States and/or other countries; (ii) if you are using the Services from a country embargoed by the United States, or are on the United States Treasury Department’s list of “Specially Designated Nationals,” you are not authorized to access or make use of the Services; and (iii) you agree to comply with all local laws, rules, and regulations including, without limitation, all laws, rules, and regulations in effect in the country in which you reside and the country from which you access the Services. The Services are not intended for distribution to, or use by, any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation, or which that would subject Kayakfirst or its affiliates to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    17. Survival
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Even if you stop using the Services, certain Terms listed here will still apply.
                    <br /><br />
                    If our relationship or these Terms terminate, it will not limit any of our other rights or remedies, and any provision of these Terms that must survive in order to give proper effect to the intent and purpose of these Terms will survive termination, including without limitation Sections 3 (Ownership and Use of Content), Section 10 (Physical Activities), 12 (No Warranties), 13 (Limitations of Liability) and 14 (Indemnification).
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    18. Miscellaneous
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    These miscellaneous provisions are part of just about every online terms agreement. Basically, they ensure that this agreement between us is enforceable.
                    <br /><br />
                    You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of the Terms or your use of the Services. The Terms and any Product-Specific Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us with respect to your use of the Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You may not assign, delegate, or otherwise transfer your account or your obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent. We have the right, in our sole discretion, to transfer or assign all or any part of our rights under these Terms and will have the right to delegate or use third-party contractors to fulfill our duties and obligations under these Terms and in connection with the Services.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Our notice to you via email, regular mail, or notices or links displayed in connection with the Services constitutes acceptable notice to you under the Terms. We are not responsible for your failure to receive notice if email is quarantined by your email security system (e.g., “junk” or “spam” folder) or if you fail to update your email address. Notice will be considered received forty-eight hours after it is sent if transmitted via email or regular mail. In the event that notice is provided via links displayed in connection with the Services, then it will be considered received twenty-four hours after it is first displayed.
<br /><br /><br /><br />

<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Appendix A: Kayakfirst Shopping
                    <br /><br />
                    By shopping with us using Kayakfirst Shopping, you agree to these terms and conditions. These terms and conditions apply to all offers and agreements in connection with the sale and delivery of products by Kayakfirst online, including if you order (i) something from underarmour.com, or Kayakfirst.com, of any of its country extensions; (ii) from any site that is directly connected to Kayakfirst.com; or (iii) any Kayakfirst e-commerce or shopping application (collectively, “Kayakfirst Shopping”).
                    <br /><br />
                    (a) Account Registration
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    An account is not required to shop via Kayakfirst Shopping. To make online shopping faster and easier, however, you may register for an account with us on one of our websites or applications. Please confirm your email address when creating your account as we will use the email address on file to contact you. If you have an account, you will have the ability to track shipments, view past orders, and quickly access your shipping and billing information with a username and password. If you do not want to set up an account, you can still purchase from Kayakfirst Shopping as a “Guest.”
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (b) Online Availability
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst strives to have the latest and greatest styles, colors and sizes available for purchase. When shopping, once you’ve selected the item you wish to purchase you can determine what color/size is in stock by first selecting the color (1.Select Color), and then the size (2.Select Size). If the size you want is not listed for the selected color, it is not available. Although Kayakfirst Shopping is designed to feature “real-time” inventory levels so that only in-stock items are visible and available for purchase, we may experience shortages of stock due to overwhelming popularity of a particular style, color or size, and cannot guarantee that items which appear to be in stock are actually available. If the item you would like to purchase is currently out of stock, we apologize for the inconvenience and encourage you to call our customer service line customer service line so that we may help you find a similar product.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (c) Locating the Style Number
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you are looking for a product’s style number, it is located inside your garment on a small white tag. It will read, for example, FW081100200 or on older styles FW060375. The first four characters reference the season of the style (ex. FW06=Fall/Winter 2006) and the last seven (on new styles) or four (on older styles) characters reference the style number. You can search this style number on our Services to find exactly what you are looking for. If no results are found, the style may no longer be manufactured by Kayakfirst. Please contact our customer service team for assistance in finding a replacement product.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (d) Ordering and Changes to Orders
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    When you place an order we will send a confirmation email to the address you have provided. If you are using your workplace email address, be aware that many corporations use spam filters to disqualify incoming automated emails, which could hamper delivery of our confirmation email to you or send it to junk mail.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The “confirmation” stage sets out the final details of your order. Following this, we will send you an order acknowledgement email detailing the products you have ordered. Please note that this email is not an order confirmation or order acceptance from Kayakfirst.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Acceptance of your order and the completion of the contract between us will occur upon our dispatch to you of the products ordered, unless we have notified you that we do not accept your order or you have cancelled it.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Due to the close time frame between order and shipment, it is difficult to make changes once your order has been placed. However, if you contact us within an hour of placing your order and we will attempt to facilitate a change.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (e) Tax
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Sales Tax and similar taxes, such as value added tax (“VAT”), are calculated using local and national rates depending on where you are located. Where VAT is applicable, you will be charged at the local rate and it will be included in the product price.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (f) Payment
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst reserves the right to supplement the list of acceptable forms of payment for Kayakfirst Shopping. We may require credit cards and debit cards to be issued by an institution in the jurisdiction in which you are located, and those forms of payment must be linked to a billing address in the same jurisdiction. Please ensure that the billing address on file with the credit or debit card-issuing bank is the same billing address you enter when ordering. We do not accept personal checks, money orders or cash payments online.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Because Kayakfirst does not charge for items until they ship, we use a pre-authorization process to reserve your products for shipment. In order to avoid unnecessary overdraft charges, a method called a “pre-authorization” is often used by banks to verify that the credit/debit card in use is valid and has sufficient funds. Please note that the transaction description will show up on your statement as “Kayakfirst.” Most authorizations expire within five to seven days; however, the issuing bank ultimately determines the length of the authorization. The final credit or debit card charge will only reflect the value of your shipped merchandise plus applicable shipping and taxes. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to call our customer service team.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you are experiencing problems with payment, please contact our customer service team—a member of our team will be happy to assist you.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (g) Delivery and Shipping
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    There are some locations that we cannot ship to, and we do not ship to post office boxes, so please confirm that we can deliver to you before placing your order.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The estimated delivery time and shipping costs for each order will be presented at checkout. While we make every effort to deliver goods within the estimated timelines, delays occasionally occur. Kayakfirst shall not be liable for any delay or failure to deliver goods within estimated timelines.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Kayakfirst reserves the right to require goods to be signed for by an adult aged 18 years or over upon delivery.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    It is not always possible for customers in one jurisdiction to purchase from Kayakfirst Shopping in another jurisdiction. Please visit our local website to see what stock is currently available to you.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    You will generally receive a tracking number via email once your package has been shipped. You can also find your tracking number(s) by logging into your account and entering the Order Number from your order confirmation email to track your package. Please allow two to four business days between placing your order and using the tracking tool.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    If you tracked your order on our website and received the message that your order is “in transit”, this simply means that your order is being processed for shipment, or that the tracking information has not yet been updated with the shipping carrier. It typically takes two to four business days for the carrier to receive our tracking information.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    We strive to ship all items in an order together, but we reserve the right to deliver your products in separate shipments if one or more items are unavailable at the time of initial shipment. In the event that we split your order into more than one shipment, you will not be charged separate shipping costs for each shipment. Further, each shipment will have a confirmation/tracking email. If we experience an issue fulfilling one part of your order, that will not serve as a basis for canceling any of the other items included in that order.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    Any orders that are delivered to you will become your property at the time that you receive them, provided that Kayakfirst has received full payment for the order.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (h) Cancellations, Exchanges and Refunds
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    The cancellation, exchange and refund policies and procedures that apply to your order may vary depending on where you are accessing Kayakfirst Shopping. For additional information about the policies that apply to a particular order, please review the policies listed in the Customer Service and Additional E-Commerce Terms section of the local website that you used to place the order.
<br /><br /><br /><br />
                    (i) Conflicts of Terms
